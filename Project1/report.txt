Abstract:
# This project investigates various filters for detecting motion in image sequences captured using a stationary camera. In these sequences, the majority of the pixels in the image belong to the stationary background, while small moving objects pass in front of the camera. The main objective is to compare different algorithms and filters for their efficacy in detecting motion. The project focuses on detecting motion by analyzing the intensity differences between the background and moving objects in the foreground. The results of the project, including the best performing algorithms and threshold cutoffs, can be found in the code repository on Github.

The purpose of this project is to explore different filters that can be used to detect motion in image sequences captured by a stationary camera. The images mostly contain a stationary background with small moving objects passing in front of the camera. The main goal is to compare the effectiveness of various algorithms and filters in detecting motion by analyzing the differences in intensity between the background and the moving objects. The findings, including the most effective algorithms and threshold cutoffs, are available in the project's Github code repository.

Introduction:

# The detection of motion in image sequences taken by a stationary camera is crucial in many applications such as video surveillance, object tracking, and event recognition. In this project, we aim to explore simple techniques for motion detection that take advantage of the stationary background in the image sequences. As the background remains constant or slowly varies, motion detection can be achieved by observing the differences in intensity between the background and the moving objects in the foreground.

# To achieve this, several algorithms and filters are designed, implemented, and compared in terms of their performance in detecting motion. The comparison involves evaluating the algorithms and filters based on various metrics such as accuracy, speed, and efficiency. The code for the project is available in the Github repository[1] linked in the Appendix. The results of this project provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working in the field of computer vision and image processing.

Detecting motion in image sequences captured by a stationary camera is critical for various applications, including object tracking, event recognition, and video surveillance. In this project, we investigate the use of simple techniques for motion detection that leverage the stationary background present in the image sequences. By observing the differences in intensity between the stationary background and moving objects in the foreground, we aim to detect motion.

To accomplish this, we design, implement, and compare several algorithms and filters based on their performance in detecting motion. We evaluate these algorithms and filters using metrics such as accuracy, speed, and efficiency. The project code is available in the Github repository[1] linked in the Appendix.
